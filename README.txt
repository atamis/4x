=====================================================

Goal:
	You have been assigned the task of making a new planets surface habitable from humans. Harvest energy from nodes to warp in buildings and create spanning energy network. The goal of the game is to get 6 warpgates. This will create a large energy burst that rids the surface of the planet from any dangers.

Controls:
	- Click on a hex tile to select it.
	- Hit tab to select the next unit that has an action.
	- Hit shift to view the energy overlay.
	- After a unit is selected, it can do 4 different things accessible via the large buttons at the bottom of the screen. Starting from the leftmost button:
		Move - This button will move a unit. Select a unit, click the "Move" button, then click where you want the unit to move. Alternatively, select a unit and right click where you want it to move. Each hex moved by a unit will consume 1 stamina.

		Build - This will open the buid submenu. Click which structure you want to build and the unit will alert the Warp Gate to warp in the building on its hex.

		Scan - This action will let the player search for energy nodes. It will reveal the energy levels of the tile the unit is standing on and all neighboring tiles. The scan action will use one of the units stamina.

		Purify - When clicked, the unit will lower the miasma level of the tile it stands on and all surrounding tiles by 1. This action takes 2 stamina.

	- The end turn button will end the players current turn. This refreshes stamina back to 4 on all of the units. Any buildings that are currently warping in will be progressed if there is enough energy in the network.
Buildings:
	Conduit - Transfers energy and connects buildings up to two tiles away. Conduits are used as a cheap way to spread the reach of your energy network. A valid energy connection is shown by a light blue line connecting buildings.

	Harvester - Generates 5 energy per turn when built on top of an energy node and 1 energy per turn when not. Connect this to your Warp Gates via Conduits.

	Purifier - A defensive structure that clears the Miasma off of one nearby tile per turn. Must be connected to an energy network to function. 

	Warp Gate - Warps in buildings and units at the expense of energy. Each Warp Gate can warp in one building at a time. Two Warp gates can warp in two buildings concurrently. Any energy generated by Harvesters is stored in the Warp Gate for future use.

Miasma
	- A quickly spreading unknown alien life form that destroys buildings and kills units. It can be cleared away by using units' purify action and by building purifiers.
